Thanks for checking out my site! Here's a little bit about me...

### Work info

By trade I'm a full stack software engineer with a focus on front end and user experience.
My main motivation is to make the interactions humans have with computers _awesome_, whether it
be end-users viewing a site that sells a product/service, or internal employees using software
to do their jobs as quickly and pain-free as possible.

I also believe that it is important for _every_ developer to have a good understanding how how their
system works from the style of the client to the schema of the database. This core value has driven
my career as a full stack developer and led me to gain skills in database design, server side scripting
and API development, application architecture, cloud development, and the list goes on.

One of my favorite aspects of this line of work is the endless amount of tools and technology to
learn about and evaluate for new and existing projects.

### Away from keyboard...

Besides coding, I enjoy spending time outside, traveling, writing, and exploring the city of
Charlotte. Over the weekends you can usually find me riding my bike to somewhere with a new beer release,
camping in Western North Carolina, or dancing at a concert in town.
