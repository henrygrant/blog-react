I've been on a bit of a hiking kick lately. Maybe it's my inner outdoorsman finally making an appearance, or maybe it has something to do with the global pandemic. 

Most of my trip was spent within about a 45 minute drive of Brevard, SC. Brevard is one of my favorite towns in NC. The real estate is cheap, there's TONS of cool stuff to do in the area, and you're not very far from Asheville. I've given some genuine thought to moving over there, but I'd only do it if I locked down a remote job I had some long-term faith in. 

Finding camping wasn't difficult. [The Davidson River Campground]() is one of my all time favorite places to car camp, but they're booked for... basically ever. Fortunately, in Pisgah National Forest, dispersed camping is allowed as long as you aren't too close to a road or river. This made finding a spot pretty trivial as long as you keep a "seek forgiveness, not permission" if you're not sure where you are is allowed. 

While up there, I got to hike to the top of Black Balsam Knob and Tennent Mountain, which was one of the best views I've ever seen in NC. The trail I hiked is a part of the Art Loeb Trail, which I had heard was beautiful but I didn't expect to feel like I was on top of the world.

In addition to hiking, I got to check out a couple of cool places off the Parkway. The [Pisgah Inn](https://www.pisgahinn.com/ "Pisgah Inn"), a small hotel on the south side of the ridge looking over what seemed like all of SW NC, was a place I definitely plan on booking a room in the future. 

Additionally, was a ranger lookout tower near the Inn that you could hike to and climb to the top of that is used to spot forest fires. After climbing what seemed like a million stairs that definitely spooked my coworker, we got to relax at the top while watching a storm on one side of the ridge get blocked by the mountains, the other side staying completely clear. It was one of the most amazing vistas I've ever seen.

Naturally though, we couldn't leave Brevard without grabbing a few beers on the way out. I really liked this one place called [The Hub](https://www.thehubpisgah.com/ "The Hub") that is a bar/outdoors store/mountain bike shop combo. It reminds me of the bike shop/bar I go to in Charlotte called [The Spoke Easy](https://www.thespokeeasyclt.com/ "The Spoke Easy"), albeit a lot more expensive. I also have to recommend the burgers at [Oskar Blues](https://www.oskarblues.com/ "Oskar Blues"), a spot I never miss when around Brevard. 

Covid-19 has shut down a lot of stuff, and overpopulated a ton of hikes that are... convenient to get to, but if this trip showed me anything it's that it's still perfectly possible to have a great time in the mountains if you're willing to take the road less traveled. I can't wait to do more exploration of the Pisgah when it gets a little less hot ðŸ˜…
