Welcome to Artist Spotlight! Finding new music has been a passion of mine for years, but I've fallen into some of the same bad habits that I imagine most of us do in the music streaming service era. The worst one to me is when you find a new artist, listen to a bunch of their tunes, make a new radio station by them and continue on your float down the river that is music discovery without ever really learning anything about that artist you just found.

These posts will be a way for me to do my due diligence for artists that really stick out and hold my attention for longer than a day or two. I'm hoping this exercise changes the way I think about artists I find, giving me more to talk about than just "Oh I love that song!"

Two Another is a Soul/R&B/Electronic duo comprised of Angus Campbell from the UK and Eliot Porter from the US. They met at the school they went to in Sydney, Australia and have bounced around various places in Australia and Europe, and they bring in inspiration from Motown, indie, 90s electronica, dance, and hip hop. The result is a funky, soulful vibe that I just can't get enough of.

Discovered by Spotify's dangerously good song suggestions, Two Another seriously grabbed my attention when [Coming Alive](https://open.spotify.com/track/3yBgUv7hHzX1K7lpQ1XEr4?si=nC3-DIK0Qm-5QwbbNtqNvg "Coming Alive - Two Another") presented itself on a station based on Tom Misch's [Disco Yes](https://open.spotify.com/track/61Ivix5DTnDPVjp1dgLyov?si=tYkFUjzoQ8ywjx-TFVgWjQ "Disco Yes - Tom Misch, Poppy Ajudha"). Something about that slow funky bassline caught me pretty quickly, making their discography the soundtrack of my next few hours of coding.

Naturally, I started with seeing what their "biggest" song was and man, it did not disappoint. [Keeping Me Under](https://open.spotify.com/track/5OQfHQN8zQwvQM2DNHUenw?si=oORqWlGdQv21E9jkQCXdYg "Keeping Me Under - Two Another") hangs out at a cool 108 bpm, brings the funky bassline, shakers, and that heavy "kick-clap kick-clap" beat that keeps your foot tapping and your head bobbing through the whole track.

[Another Tape](https://open.spotify.com/album/1DN0QNufXhUZC0iQ8PAJsT?si=EK2Wy-n-QRi3TW1icvMUrQ "Another Tape - Two Another") is the only full LP the duo has recorded, and it really shows that they aren't just a one trick pony. The album does a great job of having plenty of different sounding tracks, but never looses that classy, dreamlike atmosphere I love to have playing around the house. I'm sure the LP is going to take forever to arrive from England amidst global pandemic, but I know it'll fit in well with some other albums I throw on when having a red wine kind of evening.

They've pumped out 4 singles so far this year, my favorite being a remix of St Francis Hotel and Portugal. The Man's [Milkshake](https://open.spotify.com/track/7vHAxpb7WokhkMZVH0wDNR?si=1t5lxVkRTaW0UJkbnqGT_Q "Milkshake - St Francis Hotel, Portugal. The Man, Two Another") that brings up the tempo and brings that funky bassline, transforming a slow and spacey song to one I want to dance to. Honorable mention to [One Night](https://open.spotify.com/track/5KbCEylZwicYY9gTqxnRdv?si=pzcFg7AOS72TnWiPjam08g "One Night - Two Another") though, a slower but more bassy and emotional track that reinforces that Two Another has range within their atmosphere.

It seems like Two Another is gaining some steam around the internet, and for good reason. I'm pretty new to this hard-to-identify genre, but something about it has captivated me and I look forward to hearing what they put out over the rest of 2020.
